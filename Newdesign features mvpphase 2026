🎯 What's Still Missing (Critical Gaps)
P0 - Must Implement Before Launch
Smart Alarm Functionality ⚠️ CRITICAL
You have the design but NO implementation
This is a deal-breaker - users won't use a sleep app without an alarm
Action: Build SmartAlarmScreen + alarm service + notifications
Sleep Cycle Detection & Tracking ⚠️ CRITICAL
Designs show hypnogram, deep/light/REM tracking
Currently you only track total duration
Action: Implement accelerometer-based sleep stage detection
Sleep Score Calculation ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
Designs show "82 - EXCELLENT" score
No algorithm implemented to calculate this
Action: Create scoring system based on duration, efficiency, stages, consistency
AI Insights & Pattern Detection ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
Designs show "You tend to get 20m more deep sleep on days when you exercise"
No correlation engine exists
Action: Build analytics engine to detect patterns
Automatic Sleep Detection
Currently requires manual "Sleep Now" button
Should auto-detect when user falls asleep
Action: Implement motion-based sleep detection
Missing Screens (Need Designs + Implementation)
Current Sleep Profile Screen (onboarding step)
Your designs show "Your Sleep Profile" but need to verify it has all fields
Sleep Goals Progress Tracking
Can set goals but no progress tracking screen
Nap Completion/Summary Screen
Shows nap timer but what happens after?
Weekly/Monthly Reports Export
Designs mention "Generate Full Sleep Report" button
No report generation or PDF export
Sleep Challenges Detail View
You have main social screen but need individual challenge screens

🛠 Technical Implementation Guide
What to Build Next (Immediate Action Items)
1. Smart Alarm Screen & Service Create these files:
screens/SmartAlarmSetupScreen.tsx  - Settings UI (use your design)
screens/AlarmScreen.tsx            - Ringing alarm screen
services/alarmService.ts           - Alarm scheduling logic
services/notificationService.ts    - Enhanced for alarms
utils/sleepCycleCalculator.ts      - Wake window calculation
Key features:
Time picker (use your design's 07:30 style)
Smart window toggle (wake 0-30min early during light sleep)
Days of week selection (M T W T F S S pills)
Alarm sound picker
Vibration settings
Snooze configuration
Volume fade-in slider
Backup alarm toggle
2. Sleep Tracking Service Enhancement Enhance:
contexts/SleepContext.tsx
services/sleepTrackingService.ts
Add:
Accelerometer data collection
Sleep stage classification (basic algorithm)
Movement counting (restlessness)
Time to fall asleep calculation
Wake-up detection
Efficiency calculation (time asleep / time in bed)
3. Sleep Score Algorithm Create:
utils/sleepScoreCalculator.ts
Formula (based on your 82 score in designs):
sleepScore = (
  durationScore(25 points) +     // 7-9 hrs = full points
  qualityScore(25 points) +       // Efficiency % + wake-ups
  deepSleepScore(20 points) +     // 15-25% deep = full points
  remSleepScore(15 points) +      // 20-25% REM = full points  
  consistencyScore(15 points)     // Bedtime variation
) = Total /100
4. Update Existing Screens with Real Data Update these screens to use real calculated data:
HomeScreen.tsx - Real sleep score, deep/REM data
JournalScreen.tsx - Add hypnogram, stages chart
TrackerScreen.tsx - Connect to trends service
📊 Data Structure Additions Needed
Your current sleep records need these new fields:
interface SleepRecord {
  // Existing fields...
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  start_time: string;
  end_time: string;
  duration: number;
  
  // ADD THESE NEW FIELDS:

  wake_count: number;                    // number of wake-ups
  efficiency_percent: number;             // (time asleep / time in bed) * 100
  restlessness_score: number;            // 0-100 movement count
  
  // Stage timeline (for hypnogram)
  sleep_stages: Array<{
    timestamp: string;
    stage: 'awake' | 'light' | 'deep' | 'rem';
    duration: number;
  }>;
  
  // Disruptions
  disruptions: Array<{
    timestamp: string;
    type: 'noise' | 'movement' | 'wake';
    severity: number;
    details?: string;
  }>;
  
  // Morning data
  morning_mood: 'terrible' | 'tired' | 'okay' | 'refreshed' | 'energized';
  morning_notes: string;
  
  // Lifestyle factors (for correlations)
  tags: string[];                         // ['exercise', 'caffeine', 'alcohol', etc]
  caffeine_intake: number;                // cups

Premium features polished
Your designs are EXCELLENT and solve all the major pain points I mentioned earlier. Now you just need to implement the backend logic and connect the screens to real data. The Smart Alarm is the most critical missing piece - users absolutely need this to use your app daily. Want me to start building any of these features? I recommend starting with the Smart Alarm implementation since you have the design and it's the biggest gap.
